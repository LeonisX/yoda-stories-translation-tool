Dialogs
=======

Much of this information found [here](https://tcrf.net/Star_Wars:_Yoda_Stories_(Windows)).

There are 15 dialog windows in the `YODESK.EXE` file, 
12 of which are inherited from `Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures` and 3 are unique.

From our point of view, several dialogs used for debugging or entering cheats are interesting.
Unfortunately, only one of them can be used.

Dialog 100 is opened from the menu `Help -> About...`
