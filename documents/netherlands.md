Star Wars - Yoda Stories (USA) (15.02.1997) & Making Magic (NL)
===============================================================

This CD raised more questions than it answered.
It is known online as `Star Wars - Yoda Stories (1997)(LucasArts)(NL)`.

The content of the file system is exactly the same as `Star Wars - Yoda Stories (USA) (14.02.1997) & Making Magic`,
but there are slight differences in the structure of the disk itself.

Since no photographs or explanations found next to the disk image, we can only assume
that this is the Netherlands version of the game, and until proven otherwise, we will assume so.

The game is quite rare, and so far we can only find photos of the box on the Internet.
The text on the packaging is Dutch, but there are two features that indicate that the game has not been translated:

* Screenshots are from the US version.
* Clearly indicated that the manual for the game has been translated.

It should be noted that at this time the `Home Software` company belonged to `FunSoft`.

`Star Wars - Yoda Stories (USA) & Making Magic (NL)` is quite a strange disc.
The main difference from `Star Wars - Yoda Stories & Making Magic` is the recording time (later by about 2 hours).

| Property                      | USA date            | NL date             |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| RecordingDateAndTime          | 15.02.1997 10:26:39 | 15.02.1997 12:12:14 |
| VolumeCreationDateAndTime     | 15.02.1997 10:24:25 | 15.02.1997 12:07:48 |
| VolumeModificationDateAndTime | 15.02.1997 10:24:25 | 15.02.1997 10:24:25 |

The recording time for root directories has also been changed.

There are `307200` bytes (`150` sectors) missing from the end of the disk image.
In the original, they are filled with zeros, that is, there is no loss of significant data.
And that's probably how it was meant to be from the start.

* Recording date: `15.02.1997 12:12:14`
