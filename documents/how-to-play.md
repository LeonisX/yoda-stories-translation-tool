Rules of the game
=================

Both two `Desktop Adventures` games played in a window. 
There's no fullscreen mode and no resolution choices.
The virtual world rendered in a 288x288 pixel view.
The player's item displayed in an inventory table to the right.
Each item can be clicked to pick up and then dropped on the scene.
Below the inventory you'll find a compass that shows where the player can go, 
and indicator for the currently equipped weapon plus remaining ammo and a circular health indicator.
As the hero takes damage this changes from green, over yellow and red to black.
Once the black circle completed the player dies, and the game is over.
