Planet Type
===========

In Yoda Stories, every zone belongs to one of the following planets:

| Planet | Biome  |   Name   | Description                                    |
|:------:|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Desert | Tatooine | Desert planet, also referred to as `Nevada`    |
| 2      | Snow   | Hoth     | Snowy ice planet, also referred to as `Alaska` |
| 3      | Forest | Endor    | A forest planet, also referred to as `Oregon`  |
| 5      | Swamp  | Dagobah  | Swamp planet, used in the starting world       |

During world generation the goal puzzle dictates which planet is chosen.
Apart from `swamp` zones, only the zones with type `empty` or the chosen type are loaded when a game is in progress.

However, in Yoda Stories there are no zones without reference to the planet.
Perhaps they are in `Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures`, as well as zones belonging to biome number `4`.
