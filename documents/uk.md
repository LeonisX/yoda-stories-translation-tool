This version should be as close as possible to US version 1.0,
but we don't have a disk image for that region to be sure.

Found differences:

There are no ESRB ratings on the packaging, and ELSPA ratings are printed on the back of the boxes.

Disk:

* Serial number: `3111830`
* Mastering code: `CDD 15060 YODA STORIES PC MASTERED BY NIMBUS IFPI L127`

There is no information about the contents of the disc yet, but at least
it was printed by a different company and by a different publisher.
