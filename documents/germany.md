The text in `Star Wars - Making Magic` has been translated into German.
Otherwise, the encyclopedia does not differ from the Spanish one, with the exception of the language
and links to the home site. The demo version of `Rebel Assault II` is also unique.

Unnecessary `MAGIC/STATE.RST` file got stuck on the disk.

The contents of the `MAGIC` directory are exactly the same as the contents of the `Star Wars - Making Magic (Germany) & Rebel Assault 2 Demo` disc.

`Star Wars: Yoda Stories` lot was found, in which `Star Wars: Making Magic` is sold as a separate disc.
This fact must be verified.


The German version vs Spanish version 
-------------------------------------

Despite the fact that the German version is close to the [Spanish version](spain.md),
it has one important difference - the loading screen and Zone 0 have not been corrupted. 
This could probably indicate that a different team was working on the Spanish translation, 
or that the German version was assembled earlier.

Language differences aside, these versions are otherwise identical.

**Tiles**:

This version has 1 more tiles than the English version.

* Changed: 2091-2095, 2097-2107
* New: 2123

These tiles used in zones 76-77.

**Zones 76-77**:

**Zone 472**: differences among unused instruction arguments.

The differences in the structure of TGEN are very large.
It is interesting to observe how words in different languages change gender.
