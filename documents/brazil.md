`Guerra nas Estrelas: Historias de Yoda` is the only version of Yoda Stories from the 90s
that has almost everything translated, including the title of the game itself.
Because of this, in particular, this release could not be found for a long time.

There is no age rating on the packaging.

The game demonstrated on 04.07.1997 at the 11th `Fenasoft` exhibition.

It is not currently known if the game sold in a large box, or as a regular jewel case.

Disk:

* Recording date: `19.06.1997 11:28:54`
* Volume Space Size (LBA): `328861`
* Volume Identifier: `YODABRAZIL`
* Numbers on disk: 0824.04.0 06/97

The game was ready back in May, so it is not clear what caused the delay of 1 month.

Disc content:

* `Star Wars: Yoda Stories (Brazil)`
* `Star Wars: Making Magic (Brazil) (FA1.04) (28.01.1997)`
* `Star Wars: Rebel Assault II Demo (Brazil) (DX1.15) (06.02.1996)`
* Themed cursors, icons, wallpapers and sound effects for Windows.

`Star Wars - Making Magic` on this disc is also different from the previous ones.
The interface is completely translated, otherwise the encyclopedia does not differ from the Spanish one,
except for the language and link to the home site. The demo version of `Rebel Assault II` is also unique.


The Brazil version vs Spanish version
-------------------------------------

We can say that this is the most complete translation of Yoda Stories, 
not counting the modern translation of the game into Russian by Leonis.

`Guerra nas Estrelas: Histórias de Yoda` is the only version from the 90s 
that even translated the title of the game on the loading screen and Zone 0.
However, the quality of the graphics in the title screen is very mediocre. 
In addition, the translators have managed to modify the background.
There are no stars under the letter A in the word YODA, but star clusters 
have been added to the right of the word "DE" and to the left of Yoda's ear.

Language differences aside, these versions are otherwise identical.

**Tiles**:

So many tiles were not required even in the [French version](france.md), this is a real record!
The developers did not translate the original splash screen tiles, but added new ones.

* Changed: 2090-2108
* New: 2123-2152

These tiles used in zones `0, 76, 77`.

**Zone 0**

Apart from the text, three of these tiles have been replaced:

* [1; 3]: `1084` -> `1077`

* [2; 8]: `1084` -> `1079`

* [3; 8]: `1084` -> `1078`

**Zone 3**

Three changes made for an unknown purpose. The background became more heterogeneous.

On the left side is the original sprite, on the right is its replacement:

* [10; 4]: 0 -> 5
* [11; 5]: 0 -> 5
* [11; 10]: 0 -> 5

**Zones 76-77**:

We will not even pay attention to differences in the structure of TGEN.
